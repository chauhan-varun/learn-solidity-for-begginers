# 💡 Solidity Practice Projects

This repository contains a series of practice smart contracts written in **Solidity**, designed to help understand core Ethereum and smart contract development concepts.

Each file explores a different feature or pattern in Solidity programming — from simple arrays and loops to creating custom tokens and implementing modifiers.

## 🛠️ How to Use  

1. **Import the repository into Remix:**  

    - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).  
    - In the **File Explorer**, click the **"Connect to GitHub"** button.  
    - Enter the repository URL:  
      `https://github.com/chauhan-varun/solidity.git  `
    - The contracts will be loaded directly into Remix for you to explore and edit.  

2. **Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/):**  

    - Remix is an online Solidity compiler and development environment.  
    - You can use it directly from your browser — no local setup required.  

3. **Explore the contract files:**  

    - Open any `.sol` file from the imported repository inside Remix.  
    - Example files you can try: `array.sol`, `calculator.sol`, `uber.sol`.  

4. **Compile the contract:**  

    - Go to the **Solidity Compiler** tab in Remix.  
    - Make sure the compiler version matches (use `0.8.x` as mentioned in the contracts).  
    - Press **Compile**.  

5. **Deploy and interact with the contract:**  

    - Open the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab.  
    - Choose **Remix VM (London)** or your connected wallet provider.  
    - Deploy the contract and try out its functions directly from Remix.  

6. **Experiment and Learn:**  

    - Review the logic in each contract.  
    - Try modifying or extending them.  
    - This is a hands-on way to learn Solidity concepts like arrays, mappings, structs, modifiers, and payable functions.

> Do not deploy them on mainnet without proper security review and testing.
